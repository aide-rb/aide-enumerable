  #
  # Ruby's standard library comes with the `Singleton` module which, quite
  # surprisingly, implements the singleton design pattern.
  #
  # In short: only one instance of a class is allowed in the program
  #
  # I mean, yeah you could mimic what Ruby does in its library in order to
  # achieve this, but why do that when you can define and use `Module.new`
  # in order to create a builder in order to create a class that you can
  # then use as an instantiating Singleton for all of your, for example,
  # different environments and have it look pretty...
  #
  # And yeah, you could do this by setting data on a class's singleton,
  # maybe with class level methods and variables and cool stuff like that...
  #
  # And maybe Config.leg_count is easier to use than
  # Config.instance.leg_count even though everyone knows more dot methods
  # are better...
  #
  # OR you could use `SingletonWithArgs`, which (it goes with saying) is not
  # the obvious nor (again) probably best choice.
  #
  # @example
  #   class CoolConfig
  #     include Aide::SingletonWithArgs(:first, :second)
  #   end
  #
  #   CoolConfig.new('is the worst', 'is the best')
  #   CoolConfig.instance == CoolConfig.instance # => true
  #   CoolConfig.instance.first                  # => 'is the worst'
  #   CoolConfig.instance.second                 # => 'is the best'
  #
  #
  # TODO: allow kwargs? allow defaults?

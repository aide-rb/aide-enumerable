# aide-enumerable
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aide-rb/aide-enumerable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aide-rb/aide-enumerable)

If you're really feeling the urge to do some recursive enumeration (except really for comparative methods--those will break joyously), then this extension is for you.

Run free, for requiring this gem lets you use:
- `::Enumerable#recursive`
- `Aide::Enumerable::Recursor`

## Installation -- Not ready as not released yet

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'aide-enumerable'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install aide-enumerable
```

## TODO ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Tests? Maybe. Seems a bit safe and stable, though, and who wants that?
